defmodule Phoenix.Endpoint do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a Phoenix endpoint.

  The endpoint is the boundary where all requests to your
  web application start. It is also the interface your
  application provides to the underlying web servers.

  Overall, an endpoint has three responsibilities:

    * to provide a wrapper for starting and stopping the
      endpoint as part of a supervision tree;

    * to define an initial plug pipeline where requests
      are sent through;

    * to host web specific configuration for your
      application.

  ## Endpoints

  An endpoint is simply a module defined with the help
  of `Phoenix.Endpoint`. If you have used the `mix phoenix.new`
  generator, an endpoint was automatically generated as
  part of your application:

      defmodule YourApp.Endpoint do
        use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :your_app

        # plug ...
        # plug ...

        plug :router, YourApp.Router
      end

  Before being used, an endpoint must be explicitly started as part
  of your application supervision tree too (which is again done by
  default in generated applications):

      supervisor(YourApp.Endpoint, [])

  ## Endpoint configuration

  All endpoints are configured in your application environment.
  For example:

      config :your_app, YourApp.Endpoint,
        secret_key_base: "kjoy3o1zeidquwy1398juxzldjlksahdk3"

  Endpoint configuration is split into two categories. Compile-time
  configuration means the configuration is read during compilation
  and changing it at runtime has no effect. The compile-time
  configuration is mostly related to error handling.

  Runtime configuration, instead, is accessed during or
  after your application is started and can be read and written through the
  `config/2` function:

      YourApp.Endpoint.config(:port)
      YourApp.Endpoint.config(:some_config, :default_value)

  ### Compile-time configuration

    * `:code_reloader` - when `true`, enables code reloading functionality

    * `:debug_errors` - when `true`, uses `Plug.Debugger` functionality for
      debugging failures in the application. Recommended to be set to `true`
      only in development as it allows listing of the application source
      code during debugging. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:render_errors` - responsible for rendering templates whenever there
      is a failure in the application. For example, if the application crashes
      with a 500 error during a HTML request, `render("500.html", assigns)`
      will be called in the view given to `:render_errors`. Defaults to:

          [view: MyApp.ErrorView, default_format: "html"]

      The default format is used when none is set in the connection.

  ### Runtime configuration

    * `:root` - the root of your application for running external commands.
      This is only required if the watchers or code reloading functionality
      are enabled.

    * `:cache_static_lookup` - when `true`, static file lookup in the
      filesystem via the `static_path` function are cached. Defaults to `true`.

    * `:cache_static_manifest` - a path to a json manifest file that contains
      static files and their digested version. This is typically set to
      "priv/static/manifest.json" which is the file automatically generated
      by `mix phoenix.digest`.

    * `:http` - the configuration for the HTTP server. Currently uses
      cowboy and accepts all options as defined by
      [`Plug.Adapters.Cowboy`](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Adapters.Cowboy.html).
      Defaults to `false`.

    * `:https` - the configuration for the HTTPS server. Currently uses
      cowboy and accepts all options as defined by
      [`Plug.Adapters.Cowboy`](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Adapters.Cowboy.html).
      Defaults to `false`.

    * `:secret_key_base` - a secret key used as a base to generate secrets
      to encode cookies, session and friends. Defaults to `nil` as it must
      be set per application.

    * `:server` - when `true`, starts the web server when the endpoint
      supervision tree starts. Defaults to `false`. The `mix phoenix.server`
      task automatically sets this to `true`.

    * `:url` - configuration for generating URLs throughout the app.
      Accepts the `:host`, `:scheme`, `:path` and `:port` options. All
      keys except the `:path` one can be changed at runtime. Defaults to:

          [host: "localhost", path: "/"]

      The `:port` options requires either an integer, string, or
      `{:system, "ENV_VAR"}`. When given a tuple like `{:system, "PORT"}`,
      the port will be referenced from `System.get_env("PORT")` at runtime
      as a workaround for releases where environment specific information
      is loaded only at compile-time.

    * `:static_url` - configuration for generating URLs for static files.
      It will fallback to `url` if no option is provided. Accepts the same
      options as `url`.

    * `:watchers` - a set of watchers to run alongside your server. It
      expects a list of tuples containing the executable and its arguments.
      Watchers are guaranteed to run in the application directory but only
      when the server is enabled. For example, the watcher below will run
      the "watch" mode of the brunch build tool when the server starts.
      You can configure it to whatever build tool or command you want:

          [{"node", ["node_modules/brunch/bin/brunch", "watch"]}]

    * `:live_reload` - configuration for the live reload option.
      Configuration requires a `:paths` option which should be a list of
      files to watch. When these files change, it will trigger a reload.
      If you are using a tool like [pow](http://pow.cx) in development,
      you may need to set the `:url` option appropriately.

          [url: "ws://localhost:4000",
           paths: [Path.expand("priv/static/js/phoenix.js")]]

    * `:pubsub` - configuration for this endpoint's pubsub adapter.
      Configuration either requires a `:name` of the registered pubsub server
      or a `:name`, `:adapter`, and options which starts the adapter in
      the endpoint's supervision tree. If no name is provided, the name
      is inflected from the endpoint module. Defaults to:

          [adapter: Phoenix.PubSub.PG2]

      with advanced adapter configuration:

          [name: :my_pubsub, adapter: Phoenix.PubSub.Redis,
           host: "192.168.100.1"]

    * `:transports` - configuration for the channel transport. Check the
      transport modules for transport specific options. A list of allowed
      origins can be specified in the `:origins` key to restrict clients
      based on the given Origin header.

          [origins: ["//example.com", "http://example.com",
                     "https://example.com:8080"]]

      If no such header is sent no verification will be performed. If the
      Origin header does not match the list of allowed origins a 403 Forbidden
      response will be sent to the client.

  ## Endpoint API

  In the previous section, we have used the `config/2` function which is
  automatically generated in your endpoint. Here is a summary of all the
  functions that are automatically defined in your endpoint.

  #### Paths and URLs

    * `url(path)` - returns the URL for this endpoint with the given path
    * `static_path(path)` - returns the static path for a given asset

  #### Channels

    * `subscribe(pid, topic, opts)` - subscribes the pid to the given topic.
      See `Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe/4` for options.

    * `unsubscribe(pid, topic)` - unsubscribes the pid from the given topic.

    * `broadcast(topic, event, msg)` - broadcasts a `msg` with as `event`
      in the given `topic`.

    * `broadcast!(topic, event, msg)` - broadcasts a `msg` with as `event`
      in the given `topic`. Raises in case of failures.

    * `broadcast_from(from, topic, event, msg)` - broadcasts a `msg` from
      the given `from` as `event` in the given `topic`.

    * `broadcast_from!(from, topic, event, msg)` - broadcasts a `msg` from
      the given `from` as `event` in the given `topic`. Raises in case of failures.

  #### Endpoint configuration

    * `start_link()` - starts the Endpoint supervision tree, including its
      configuration cache and possibly the servers for handling requests
    * `config(key, default)` - access the endpoint configuration given by key
    * `config_change(changed, removed)` - reload the endpoint configuration
      on application upgrades

  #### Plug API

    * `init(opts)` - invoked when starting the endpoint server
    * `call(conn, opts)` - invoked on every request (simply dispatches to
      the defined plug pipeline)
