defmodule Phoenix.Channel do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a Phoenix Channel.

  Channels provide a means for bidirectional communication from clients that
  integrate with the `Phoenix.PubSub` layer for soft-realtime functionality.

  ## Topics & Callbacks

  When clients join a channel, they do so by subscribing to a topic.
  Topics are string identifiers in the `Phoenix.PubSub` layer that allow
  multiple processes to subscribe and broadcast messages about a given topic.
  Everytime you join a Channel, you need to choose which particular topic you
  want to listen to. The topic is just an identifier, but by convention it is
  often made of two parts: `"topic:subtopic"`. Using the `"topic:subtopic"`
  approach pairs nicely with the `Phoenix.Router.channel/3` macro to match
  topic patterns in your router to your channel handlers:

      socket "/ws", MyApp do
        channel "rooms:*", RoomChannel
      end

  Any topic coming into the router with the `"rooms:"` prefix, would dispatch
  to `MyApp.RoomChannel` in the above example. Topics can also be pattern
  matched in your channels' `join/3` callback to pluck out the scoped pattern:

      # handles the special `"lobby"` subtopic
      def join("rooms:lobby", _auth_message, socket) do
        {:ok, socket}
      end

      # handles any other subtopic as the room ID, ie `"rooms:12"`, `"rooms:34"`
      def join("rooms:" <> room_id, auth_message, socket) do
        {:ok, socket}
      end

  ### Authorization

  Clients must join a channel to send and receive PubSub events on that channel.
  Your channels must implement a `join/3` callback that authorizes the socket
  for the given topic. It is common for clients to send up authorization data,
  such as HMAC'd tokens for this purpose.

  To authorize a socket in `join/3`, return `{:ok, socket}`.
  To refuse authorization in `join/3`, return `{:error, reply}`.

  ### Incoming Events

  After a client has successfully joined a channel, incoming events from the
  client are routed through the channel's `handle_in/3` callbacks. Within these
  callbacks, you can perform any action. Typically you'll either forward a
  message to all listeners with `Phoenix.Channel.broadcast!/3`, or push a message
  directly down the socket with `Phoenix.Channel.push/3`.
  Incoming callbacks must return the `socket` to maintain ephemeral state.

  Here's an example of receiving an incoming `"new_msg"` event from one client,
  and broadcasting the message to all topic subscribers for this socket.

      def handle_in("new_msg", %{"uid" => uid, "body" => body}, socket) do
        broadcast! socket, "new_msg", %{uid: uid, body: body}
        {:noreply, socket}
      end

  You can also push a message directly down the socket:

      # client asks for their current rank, push sent directly as a new event.
      def handle_in("current:rank", socket) do
        push socket, "current:rank", %{val: Game.get_rank(socket.assigns[:user])}
        {:noreply, socket}
      end

  ### Replies

  In addition to pushing messages out when you receive a `handle_in` event,
  you can also reply directly to a client event for request/response style
  messaging. This is useful when a client must know the result of an operation
  or to simply ack messages.

  For example, imagine creating a resource and replying with the created record:

      def handle_in("create:post", attrs, socket) do
        changeset = Post.changeset(%Post{}, attrs)

        if changeset.valid? do
          Repo.insert!(changeset)
          {:reply, {:ok, changeset}, socket}
        else
          {:reply, {:error, changeset.errors}, socket}
        end
      end

  Alternatively, you may just want to ack the status of the operation:

      def handle_in("create:post", attrs, socket) do
        changeset = Post.changeset(%Post{}, attrs)

        if changeset.valid? do
          Repo.insert!(changeset)
          {:ok, socket}
        else
          {:reply, :error, socket}
        end
      end

  ### Outgoing Events

  When an event is broadcasted with `Phoenix.Channel.broadcast/3`, each channel
  subscriber's `handle_out/3` callback is triggered where the event can be
  relayed as is, or customized on a socket by socket basis to append extra
  information, or conditionally filter the message from being delivered.

      def handle_in("new_msg", %{"uid" => uid, "body" => body}, socket) do
        broadcast! socket, "new_msg", %{uid: uid, body: body}
        {:noreply, socket}
      end

      # for every socket subscribing to this topic, append an `is_editable`
      # value for client metadata.
      def handle_out("new_msg", msg, socket) do
        push socket, "new_msg", Map.merge(msg,
          is_editable: User.can_edit_message?(socket.assigns[:user], msg)
        )
        {:noreply, socket}
      end

      # do not send broadcasted `"user:joined"` events if this socket's user
      # is ignoring the user who joined.
      def handle_out("user:joined", msg, socket) do
        unless User.ignoring?(socket.assigns[:user], msg.user_id) do
          push socket, "user:joined", msg
        end
        {:noreply, socket}
      end

  By default, unhandled outgoing events are forwarded to each client as a push,
  but you'll need to define the catch-all clause yourself once you define an
  `handle_out/3` clause.

  ## Broadcasting to an external topic

  In some cases, you will want to broadcast messages without the context of a `socket`.
  This could be for broadcasting from within your channel to an external topic, or
  broadcasting from elsewhere in your application like a Controller or GenServer.
  For these cases, you can broadcast from your Endpoint. Its configured PubSub
  server will be used:

      # within channel
      def handle_in("new_msg", %{"uid" => uid, "body" => body}, socket) do
        ...
        broadcast_from! socket, "new_msg", %{uid: uid, body: body}
        MyApp.Endpoint.broadcast_from! self(), "rooms:superadmin", "new_msg", %{uid: uid, body: body}
        {:noreply, socket}
      end

      # within controller
      def create(conn, params) do
        ...
        MyApp.Endpoint.broadcast! "rooms:" <> rid, "new_msg", %{uid: uid, body: body}
        MyApp.Endpoint.broadcast! "rooms:superadmin", "new_msg", %{uid: uid, body: body}
        redirect conn, to: "/"
      end

  ## Terminate

  On termination, the channel callback `terminate/2` will be invoked with
  the error reason and the socket.

  If we are terminating because the client left, the reason will be
  `{:shutdown, :left}`. Similarly, if we are terminating because the
  client connection was closed, the reason will be `{:shutdown, :closed}`.

  If any of the callbacks return a stop tuple, that will also trigger
  terminate, with the given reason.

  Note `terminate/2` may also be invoked in case of errors or exits
  but only if the current process is trapping exits. This practice,
  however, is typically not recommended.
