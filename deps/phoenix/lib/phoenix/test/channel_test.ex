defmodule Phoenix.ChannelTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Conveniences for testing Phoenix channels.

  In channel tests, we interact with channels via process
  communication, sending and receiving messages. It is also
  common to subscribe to the same topic the channel subscribes
  to, allowing us to assert if a given message was broadcast
  or not.

  ## Channel testing

  To get started, define the module attribute `@endpoint`
  in your test case pointing to your application endpoint.

  Then you can directly `subscribe_and_join/3` topics and
  channels:

      {:ok, _, socket} =
        subscribe_and_join(RoomChannel, "rooms:lobby", %{"id" => 3})

  The function above will subscribe the current test process
  to the "rooms:lobby" topic and start a channel in another
  process. It returns `{:ok, reply, socket}` or `{:error, reply}`.

  Now, in the same way the channel has a socket representing
  communication it will push to the client. Our test has a
  socket representing communication to be pushed to the server.

  For example, we can use the `push/3` function in the test
  to push messages to the channel (it will invoke `handle_in/3`):

      push socket, "my_event", %{"some" => "data"}

  Similarly, we can broadcast messages from the test itself
  on the topic that both test and channel are subscribed to,
  triggering `handle_out/3` on the channel:

      broadcast_from socket, "my_event", %{"some" => "data"}

  > Note only `broadcast_from/3` and `broadcast_from!/3` are
  available in tests to avoid broadcast messages to be resent
  to the test process.

  While the functions above are pushing data to the channel
  (server) we can use `assert_push/3` to verify the channel
  pushed a message to the client:

      assert_push "my_event", %{"some" => "data"}

  Or even assert something was broadcast into pubsub:

      assert_broadcast "my_event", %{"some" => "data"}

  Finally, every time a message is pushed to the channel,
  a reference is returned. We can use this reference to
  assert a particular reply was sent from the server:

      ref = push socket, "counter", %{}
      assert_reply ref, :ok, %{"counter" => 1}

  ## Checking side-effects

  Often one may want to do side-effects inside channels,
  like writing to the database, and verify those side-effects
  during their tests.

  Imagine the following `handle_in/3` inside a channel:

      def handle_in("publish", %{"id" => id}, socket) do
        Repo.get!(Post, id) |> Post.publish() |> Repo.update!()
        {:noreply, socket}
      end

  Because the whole communication is asynchronous, the
  following test would be very brittle:

      push socket, "publish", %{"id" => 3}
      assert Repo.get_by(Post, id: 3, published: true)

  The issue is that we have no guarantees the channel has
  done processing our message after calling `push/3`. The
  best solution is to assert the channel sent us a reply
  before doing any other assertion. First change the
  channel to send replies:

      def handle_in("publish", %{"id" => id}, socket) do
        Repo.get!(Post, id) |> Post.publish() |> Repo.update!()
        {:reply, :ok, socket}
      end

  Then expect them in the test:

      ref = push socket, "publish", %{"id" => 3}
      assert_reply ref, :ok
      assert Repo.get_by(Post, id: 3, published: true)

  ## Leave and close

  This module also provides functions to simulate leaving
  and closing a channel. Once you leave or close a channel,
  because the channel is linked to the test process on join,
  it will crash the test process:

      leave(socket)
      ** (EXIT from #PID<...>) {:shutdown, :leave}

  You can avoid this by unlinking the channel process in
  the test:

      Process.unlink(socket.channel_pid)

  Notice `leave/1` is async, so it will also return a
  reference which you can use to check for a reply:

      ref = leave(socket)
      assert_reply ref, :ok

  On the other hand, close is always sync and it will
  return only after the channel process is guaranteed to
  have been terminated:

      :ok = close(socket)

  This mimics the behaviour existing in clients.
